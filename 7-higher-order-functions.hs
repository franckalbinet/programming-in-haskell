-- 7.1 Basic concepts
add :: Int -> Int -> Int
add x y = x + y

-- actually means
add_l :: Int -> (Int -> Int)
add_l = \x -> (\y -> x + y)

twice :: (a -> a) -> a -> a
twice f x = f (f x)

-- 7.2 Processing lists
map_my :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
map_my f xs = [f x | x <- xs]

map_r :: (a -> b) -> [a] -> [b]
map_r f [] = []
map_r f (x:xs) = f x : map_r f xs

filter_my :: (a -> Bool) -> [a] -> [a]

-- 7.3 The foldr function
-- Foldr versions of sum, product, or, and
sum_foldr :: Num a => [a] -> a

-- 7.4 The foldl function
sum_my :: Num a => [a] -> a
sum_my = sum' 0
    where 
        sum' v [] = v
        sum' v (x:xs) = sum' (v+x) xs

-- Functions previously defined using foldr can be redefined. 
-- Ex. of sum:
sum_foldl :: Num a => [a] -> a
sum_foldl = foldl (+) 0

foldl_my :: (a -> b -> a) -> a -> [b] -> a
foldl_my f v [] = v

-- NaÃ®ve implementation
bin2int_naive :: [Bit] -> Int
bin2int_naive bits = sum [w*b | (w,b) <- zip weights bits]

-- Using foldr

int2bin :: Int -> [Bit]

int2bin n = n `mod` 2 : int2bin (n `div` 2)

make8 :: [Bit] -> [Bit]
make8 bits = take 8 (bits ++ repeat 0)

encode :: String -> [Bit]
encode = concat . map (make8 . int2bin . ord)

decode :: [Bit] -> String

transmit :: String -> String

-- 7.7 Voting algorithms
-- First past the post
votes :: [String]
votes = ["Red","Blue","Green","Blue","Blue","Red"]

rmdups :: Eq a => [a] -> [a]
